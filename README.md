## Description
Welcome to the Book Search Engine PWA! This project transforms a traditional book search engine into a modern Progressive Web Application (PWA) using GraphQL and Apollo Server. By upgrading from a RESTful API to GraphQL, the application achieves enhanced performance and flexibility in fetching and managing book data. Leveraging the MERN stack with React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js, the Book Search Engine ensures seamless integration and reliability. Users can effortlessly search for books, save them to their account, and manage their reading list. The application also features user authentication, allowing users to securely log in, sign up, and access their saved books. Deployed on Render with MongoDB Atlas for database management, this Book Search Engine PWA delivers a streamlined and efficient book browsing experience for avid readers.

## Technologies
The technologies I used in this challenge includes:

1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB database
4. MongoDB Atlas
5. Concurrently
6. Apollo Server
7. Render
8. React
9. GraphQL
10. Visual Studio Code(VS-code)
11. Github: Github was used to create a repository which includes all the required files, links to the projects, package.json, npmrc file, gitignore and the README file.
12. Gitlab: Gitlab was used to clone the project to our laptop.

## Installation
1. To install the challenge#21 , first create a new repository in your Github account, and then clone this repository to your local computer. 
```
To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git   
```           

2. Open the cloned repository in a visual studio code.
 
3. Open integrated terminal in the root directory in order to run "npm install" on the command line to install dependencies.

4. To launch the server and view the application in the browser, navigate to the root directory and execute the command "npm run develop".

## Usage
1. Open the repository, run 'npm install' to install dependencies.

2. Open integrated terminal in the root directory in order to run "npm run develop" to start the server. 

3. View the application either locally by running it on your machine or open the deployed application in your web browser.

4. Upon accessing the application, you should see the Book Search Engine interface. Upon loading the book search engine, users will be prompted with the following options "Search for Books", "Login/Signup", and "Searchbar".

5. Upon opening the application, users are prompted to access the menu where they can either log in or sign up using a modal, allowing them to create a new account or log in to an existing one.

6. Additionally, upon entering a search query and submitting it, users can browse through search results, each displaying book details, and save desired books to their account with a click of a button.

7. Users can view their saved books, each displaying details, and delete unwanted books from their account.
